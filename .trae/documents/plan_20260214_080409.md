I will optimize the mobile layout to look professional and polished while preserving the desktop design exactly as it is.

### **Planned Changes**

#### **1. Homepage Mobile Refinements (`src/app/page.tsx`)**
- **Typography**: Reduce the massive Hero heading on mobile (`text-5xl` → `text-4xl`) so it doesn't dominate the screen, while keeping it large on desktop.
- **Section Spacing**: Reduce vertical padding on all sections from `py-24` (too spacious for mobile) to `py-12` on mobile, restoring `py-24` on desktop.
- **Grid Gaps**: Tighten the spacing between Feature cards and Product cards on mobile (`gap-8` → `gap-6`) to reduce scrolling.
- **Card Padding**: Reduce internal padding of Feature cards on mobile (`p-8` → `p-6`) to make better use of screen width.

#### **2. Testimonial Carousel Optimization (`src/components/testimonial-carousel.tsx`)**
- **Card Width**: Reduce the width of testimonial cards on mobile (`350px` → `290px`) so they don't look oversized on small screens, while keeping the wider `400px` size for desktop.
- **Content Density**: Adjust internal padding to fit the smaller width comfortably.

These changes ensure the mobile experience feels native and "app-like" with appropriate density, without touching the desktop layout you already like.
